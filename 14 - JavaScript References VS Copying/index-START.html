    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100, 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200, 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    const team = players;
    console.log(team) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // now here is the problem!
    console.log(players) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    team2[2] = 'Ron';
    console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Max';
    console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[4] = 'Fred';
    console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[5] = 'New Guy';
    console.log(players); // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 90;
    console.log(person.number); // 90

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number2: 95});
    console.log(person) // {name: 'Wes Bos', age: 80, number: 90}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person, number3: 100};
    console.log(person, cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
